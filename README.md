## Known Limitations and Trade-offs

### 1. Code is not well-tested

The current code lacks unit and integration tests, which can lead to bugs which might not be seen while using. Adding test will allow to find bugs in development.

### 2. Limited UI customization

The UI is functional but basic. There are no advanced features like making templates, sytling, advanced options for tasks/columsn , searching and more.

### 3. Time constraints

Some features were simplified to meet deadlines, the more extra features can be added with more time. The limited features were made to accomplish a good/working product in limited time.

## Future Improvements

### 1. Testing

Implementing unit and integrations tests to find bugs/issues in development.

### 2. Better UI/UX

Improve the design with more features, stylings, templates and more options.
